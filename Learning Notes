## Learning Notes

- Added javaFX as dependencies in Maven
- Add module-info.java file to link the required modules
- Add (requires transitive javafx.graphics;) in the module-info as this was causing failure to load
- Change Run configuration and pointer the application.main to the correct location under (Main Class)

- module reflection issues - added to module (opens application to javafx.fxml)
